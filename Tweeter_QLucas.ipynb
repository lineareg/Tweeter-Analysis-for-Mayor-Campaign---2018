    "#### • The unstructured data such as twitter or news feeds both have similarity, however, the news feed dataset has information that has gone through some sort of review by editors in compared to twitter data. The collection of data from twitter  is efficient then HTML since there is no need to look up page source code to find text to mine. However, Twitter , is subject to the limitations posed by Twitter; the rate-limit and the fact that you cannot search for twitter messages older than 7 days is an issue for creating predictive models. To answer question such as customer’s sentiment twitter feed is more relevant. However, in order to get current affairs, news feed is much important.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### • The context of the question should be used to determine what data source to be used. For instance if we want to understand sentiment of population that is unbiased (e.g. How do customers feels about amazon purchasing Whole foods?) than twitter might be valuable. However, in the case of finding investor’s sentiment, stock price fluctuations or editorial analysis can be used."
